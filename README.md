## Pitch Description
Bridge crypto holdings with traditional finance to earn interest without asset transfer. A transparent, secure platform for crypto investors and institutions to grow together.


## Problem Statement
The crypto market lacks stable, secure avenues for holders to earn interest on their assets without risking ownership, while traditional financial institutions miss out on tapping into the growing cryptocurrency assets due to regulatory and compliance risks.

## Solution Statement
Our platform leverages the XRPL escrow function to allow crypto holders to safely earn interest on their assets, held in term-based pools, without transferring ownership. Institutions can access these assets for balance sheet enhancement, offering competitive interest rates to crypto investors.

## Potential Users and Institutional Customer Roles and Benefits

- **Users: Crypto investors seeking low-risk interest on their holdings without sacrificing asset control.
- **Institutions: Banks and financial entities looking to diversify and stabilize their asset bases with cryptocurrency, without direct exposure or regulatory complexity.

## Features and Future States

- Features: Wallet whitelisting, KYC compliance, interest-earning crypto pools, transparent transactions, and secure asset holding.
- Future States**: Expansion to include a broader range of cryptocurrencies, deeper integration with traditional financial products, and advanced smart contract functionalities for automated pool management and payouts.

## What Will Be in the POC and How We Plan to Make It Work

- In the POC: Basic wallet integration, mockup of asset pools, simulated interest earnings, and a simple user and institutional interface.
- Execution Plan: Utilize XRPL for the secure, escrow-based holding of assets. Develop a frontend interface for user interaction and a backend to manage the pools and transactions, demonstrating the core concept and viability.

## Technologies Used for the POC

- XRPL: For escrow functions and the secure, transparent handling of cryptocurrency assets.
- Frontend: Basic web technologies for the interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Backend: Node.js for server-side logic, interfacing with XRPL, and managing user interactions.

## Pools
A bank chooses a currency (XRP, ETH, WBTC, USDT...) and an interest rate (5%), and requirements (Non US Person, KYC requirements, High Net Worth Individual...)


## Conclusion
Our platform uniquely positions itself at the intersection of cryptocurrency and traditional finance, offering a novel solution to the dual challenges of earning potential for crypto holders and asset diversification for institutions. By leveraging the secure, transparent capabilities of XRPL, we propose a future where crypto assets are not just stored but actively contribute to market stability and individual growth.
